The Team Profile Generator is a command-line-input application run in Node that requests information from the user about members of an engineering team and generates an HTML file displaying taht information. Before running the application the user must perform an npm install to install all required dependencies.

Upon launching the app, the user is asked to describe the first memeber of their team. The users enters the team member's name, selects that member's role from a list(options include "Engineer," "Intern," and "Manager"), enters the member's ID (any string), enters the member's email address, and the must enter another piece of information that will differ depending on what role was selected. If "Engineer" was selected, the app asks the user for the ream member's GitHub username; if "Intern" was selected, the member's school is requested; and if "Manager" was chosen, the suer is prompted for the team memebr's phone number.
